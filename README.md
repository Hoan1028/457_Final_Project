## 457_Final_Project: Staff.Me
Repository for the final project I did in IS457 taught by CSULB Professor Jiangqing (Fisher) Wu

## Project Description
This project is an opportunity for me to use the knowledge learned from class to build an app for a purpose of my choosing.
This app is called Staff.Me, it allows a user in a hypothetical HR department or recruitment company to look at a list of candidates,
look at a detailed modal view of the candidate's profile and hire them to their team. 
On the *My Team* tab, the user can review the members that they have hired and they also have the option to kick members off the team.
Lastly, on the *Sign-Up* tab, users can choose to add themselves or other candidates to the database. 


## Getting Started
If you want to run and host this app on your local machine, You can run the code and serve the app locally with VS Code so long as you have the dependent packages installed. A step by step guide to setting up the environment and running your first app can be found [here](https://github.com/Hoan1028/457_Final_Project/blob/master/IS457-L02.pptx). To run this project, simply download and copy the src folder over to the app you made in the guide, save your changes, and run the app again with the *ionic serve* command.
